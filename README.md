# Heart Rate Extraction Application

## Overview
Welcome to Heart Rate Extraction Application, a client-server desktop application developed in Python for extracting heart rates from patients using recorded or live video. The application features a user-friendly UI to manage patient and user data, stored efficiently in JSON data files. The heart rate extraction process involves a sophisticated pipeline, outlined below.

## Pipeline for Heart Rate Extraction
**1. Receiving Video Input:**
- Handling both recorded and live video streams at 30 Hz, 1920x1080 resolution.

**2. Locating the Eyes Using Haar Cascade Classifier**
- Employing Haar cascade classifier to precisely identify eyes in video frames.

**3. Locating the Region of Interest (ROI)**
- Selecting the forehead as the ROI post eye detection, leveraging its suitability for pulse detection.

**4. Addressing the Green Color Channel**
- Converting ROI to RGB, isolating the green channel, and applying median calculation for noise reduction.

**5. Performing FFT**
- Applying Fast Fourier Transform on the green channel data to transition from time domain to frequency domain, enhancing signal clarity by adjusting sample size.

**6. Calculating Absolute FFT Values**
- Deriving absolute values from the FFT output to process frequency components effectively.

**7. Calculating Heart Rate Thresholds**
- Determining low and high heart rate thresholds to identify potential heart rate frequencies based on FFT analysis.

**8. Searching for the Highest Value in Threshold Range**
- Identifying the peak frequency within the calculated heart rate thresholds indicative of the actual heart rate.

**9. Calculating the Heart Rate Frequency**
- Using the peak frequency to calculate the heart rate frequency with a refined formula.

**10. Calculating the Heart Rate**
- Converting heart rate frequency to beats per minute (BPM) to determine the patient's heart rate.
